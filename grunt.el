;;; Commentary:

;; I got tired of managing shells and one off Async Command buffers to
;; kick off Grunt tasks. This package provides rudimentary access to
;; the tasks in a Gruntfile.

;; When your default-directory is somewhere in a JS project with a
;; Gruntfile, invoke `grunt-exec' or bind something to it. You can
;; either execute one of the suggested registered tasks, or input a
;; custom task of your own. It will create one buffer per project per
;; task, killing any existing buffers by default.

path to the Gruntfile.js being used changes.  That is, when you
switch projects to one with a different Gruntfile, that's the
next time we'll invoke `grunt --help`.  This improves the speed of
`grunt-exec', but won't pick up changes to the content of the
current Gruntfile.js.

To have us suggest new/changed tasks after editing the current

If t, then you can move your point around the task buffer as you
please, and if you want to follow the new content from your task,
